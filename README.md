## Overview

Telecom companies face significant challenges in retaining customers due to high churn rates. This project aims to **analyze telecom customer churn** using **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **machine learning models** to predict which customers are likely to churn.  

The analysis covers:  
- Understanding **customer demographics**, including age, gender, marital status, city, and zip code.  
- Examining **service usage patterns**, such as phone service, internet service, online security, streaming, and other subscriptions.  
- Investigating **contract types, payment methods, and offers** that may influence churn behavior.  
- Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features for machine learning.  
- Building predictive models using **Random Forest, Gradient Boost, Extra Trees, AdaBoost, Decision Tree, KNN, XGBoost, and LightGBM**.  
- Evaluating models using **accuracy, cross-validation, confusion matrices, and classification reports**.  
- Identifying the **most important features** that drive churn decisions.  

The goal is to provide actionable insights and a robust predictive model to help telecom companies **reduce churn and improve customer retention**.


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this section, we explore the telecom customer dataset to uncover patterns and relationships that may influence churn. The EDA is divided into five parts for better clarity.
