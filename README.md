## Overview

Telecom companies face significant challenges in retaining customers due to high churn rates. This project aims to **analyze telecom customer churn** using **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **machine learning models** to predict which customers are likely to churn.  

The analysis covers:  
- Understanding **customer demographics**, including age, gender, marital status, city, and zip code.  
- Examining **service usage patterns**, such as phone service, internet service, online security, streaming, and other subscriptions.  
- Investigating **contract types, payment methods, and offers** that may influence churn behavior.  
- Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features for machine learning.  
- Building predictive models using **Random Forest, Gradient Boost, Extra Trees, AdaBoost, Decision Tree, KNN, XGBoost, and LightGBM**.  
- Evaluating models using **accuracy, cross-validation, confusion matrices, and classification reports**.  
- Identifying the **most important features** that drive churn decisions.  

The goal is to provide actionable insights and a robust predictive model to help telecom companies **reduce churn and improve customer retention**.
