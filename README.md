# Telecom Customer Retention Analysis using Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning
Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges faced by telecom companies, as losing subscribers can significantly impact revenue and long-term growth. This project focuses on analyzing and predicting telecom customer churn using a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques. The dataset contains comprehensive information on customer demographics, service usage, contracts, payment methods, and churn status, providing an opportunity to uncover meaningful patterns and insights.

The project begins with exploratory data analysis, visualizing overall distributions, as well as the effects of gender, marital status, top cities, and age on churn and service adoption. Missing values are carefully handled through median imputation for numerical columns and strategic replacement for categorical features, ensuring a clean dataset for modeling. Categorical variables are encoded using one-hot encoding, while numerical features are scaled using StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler to improve model performance.

Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Extra Trees, AdaBoost, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Models were assessed using accuracy, cross-validation, confusion matrices, and classification reports, with tree-based ensemble models achieving near-perfect performance. Feature importance analysis revealed the key drivers of churn, such as contract type, service usage, and demographic factors, providing actionable insights for retention strategies.

Overall, this project demonstrates a comprehensive end-to-end approach to telecom churn prediction, from data exploration and preprocessing to predictive modeling and feature interpretation. It serves as both a practical tool for telecom companies and a case study in applying machine learning techniques to real-world customer data.

## Overview

Telecom companies face significant challenges in retaining customers due to high churn rates. This project aims to **analyze telecom customer churn** using **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **machine learning models** to predict which customers are likely to churn.  

The analysis covers:  
- Understanding **customer demographics**, including age, gender, marital status, city, and zip code.  
- Examining **service usage patterns**, such as phone service, internet service, online security, streaming, and other subscriptions.  
- Investigating **contract types, payment methods, and offers** that may influence churn behavior.  
- Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features for machine learning.  
- Building predictive models using **Random Forest, Gradient Boost, Extra Trees, AdaBoost, Decision Tree, KNN, XGBoost, and LightGBM**.  
- Evaluating models using **accuracy, cross-validation, confusion matrices, and classification reports**.  
- Identifying the **most important features** that drive churn decisions.  

The goal is to provide actionable insights and a robust predictive model to help telecom companies **reduce churn and improve customer retention**.

## Dataset

This project uses a public telecom customer churn dataset, which contains **two CSV tables**:

- **Customer Churn Table:** Information on 7,043 California telecom customers in Q2 2022, including demographics, location, tenure, subscription services, and churn status.  
- **Zip Code Population Table:** Estimated populations for the California zip codes in the Customer Churn table.  

The dataset is publicly available on **Maven Analytics**:  
[Telecom Customer Churn Dataset â€“ Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/blog/maven-churn-challenge)  

The goal of this project is to perform **exploratory data analysis** and document insights that can guide **BI reports** (Power BI, Tableau, etc.).


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this section, we explore the telecom customer dataset to uncover patterns and relationships that may influence churn. The EDA is divided into five parts for better clarity.
